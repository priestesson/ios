Just be yourself, there is no one better.

I'm intimidated by the fear of being average.

The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.

No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.

There are no rules when it comes to love.

All you need to do to be my friend is like me.

In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.

People haven't always been there for me but music always has.

Music is my shining light, my favorite thing in the world. T get me to stop doing it for one second would be difficult!

Turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you...
